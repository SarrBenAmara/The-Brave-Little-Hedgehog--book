Harry was small but brave. He loved exploring        the forest and discovering new places, even if it         meant facing his fears.","One bright morning, Harry decided to visit the tallest         tree in the forest. On his way, he heard a loud noise         and saw a big, fierce-looking bear stuck in a trap. The        bear was growling and struggling to free himself. All        the other animals were too scared to help, but         Harry's heart was filled with courage.","Harry approached the bear cautiously. \"Don't worry,         Mr. Bear,\" Harry said. \"I'll help you get out.\" Using his        sharp quills, Harry carefully pried open the trap until         the bear was free. The bear thanked Harry for his        bravery and promised to always be his friend.","A few days later, a terrible storm swept through the         forest. The strong winds knocked down trees, and         the river began to overflow. Harry's friends, the        rabbits, were trapped on the other side of the river,        unable to get back to their burrow.","Harry knew he had                                                   to do something.                                                    Despite the raging                                                   storm, he bravely                                                    swam across the                                                   river with a long                                                    vine in his mouth.                                                   He tied the vine to                                                    a sturdy tree on                                                   one side and to a                                                    big rock on the                                                   other, creating a                                                    bridge for the                                                   rabbits to cross                                                    safely.","The rabbits were so grateful to Harry for his bravery.         They hugged him and thanked him for saving their        lives. Harry felt proud and happy, knowing that his         bravery had made a big difference.","As time went on, Harry continued to face his fears         and help his friends. He discovered that being brave         didn't mean he wasn't afraid; it meant he didn't let        fear stop him from doing what was right.","Remember                                                                                  True bravery is not the                                                                            absence of fear, but the                                                                             willingness to act despite it.
